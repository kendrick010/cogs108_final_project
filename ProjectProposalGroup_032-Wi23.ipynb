    "Many can agree that the greatest benefit to attending school is an eduction. Yet, school also yields other invaluable benefits, such as connections and human development. From personal experience, these benefits are factors that can aid in academic performance beyond textbook studying. For instance, a student with many friends is more likely to reach out for help or form a group to advance their studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, all students learn at different paces and perform best in environments which suit their personalities [2]. As some studies have deduced, personality can predict academic achievement, as higher extraversion can positively associate with GPA [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Our topic of interest is finding individual factors, beyond purely studying, that potentially influences one’s academic performance. Specifically, we chose to scale these factors into Big Five personalities, as they have been widely used as predictors in educational studies [1]. These five factors are referred to as neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, conscientiousness, and agreeableness.\n",

    "The **ideal** dataset we would like for our research would be surveys, questionnaires, or scraped information on students' academic performance (i.e. test scores, GPAs, etc.) and Big Five personality. At the minimum, the variables should be relevant to academic performance and the Big Five personalities. Since we are performing correlational research, we would ideally need +100 observations. These datasets should be yielded from students, ideally of broad fields of studies. Sources that we can depend on finding such datasets would be subsidiaries, such as Kaggle, or research papers. The data we will use for our research will be stored and organized in a private repository on GitHub https://github.com/COGS108/Group_032-Wi23 \n",

    "Our project used datasets pertaining to student’s academic performances, specifically on GPA, and their respective Big Five personality scores. All of our datasets were either found on Kaggle, a specialized Data Science community that caters to publishing as public datasets, or research papers via Google Scholar. The datasets we have collected are anonymous thus unable to reveal personal information. Some limitations or biases of our selected datasets is that it is exclusive to the population of students within the engineering and medical field. Therefore, our findings may not generalize to all students."
